Centering an HTML element on a page can be a tricky task, especially if you don't use the right technique. In this blog post, we will show you how to use flexbox to center an HTML element both horizontally and vertically on a page. This is a great technique to use when you want to create a landing page or improve the layout of your website. Let's get started!

.centered-element {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```
